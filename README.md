# 🫀 CardioLlama — A Clinical Language Model for Cardiology

**CardioLlama** is a domain-adapted large language model fine-tuned specifically for cardiology and clinical medicine.  
It is built on the **LLaMA-2-7B** architecture and fine-tuned using **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation), enabling parameter-efficient training on domain-specific texts such as clinical notes, ECG interpretations, discharge summaries, and guidelines.
