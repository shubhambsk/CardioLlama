I am a 40 year old female and have have some mildly high blood pressure readings over the past couple years. I am not over weight and fairly physically active. My reading can vary quite a bit but my systolic is usually 120-135, my diastolic can be around 84 up to 95 at times. I read and have gotten some conflicting recommendations if I need BP meds, it seems that systolic is the number of more concern, is this correct or is that just for older adults? Since I am young I would rather not be on BP meds if I do not have to. Are any supplements recommended besides reducing salt, diet, exercise, all these things I have already done. Thank you for your answer!,hello, after going through your medical query i understand your concern and would like to tell you that definitely lifestyle modification like low dietary salt, moderate exercise can keep your blood pressure healthy. keep noticing your blood pressure, if after lifestyle modification your blood pressure is more than 140/90 then only you need medication otherwise continue with a healthy lifestyle. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.

There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure.

Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as AF that can increase the risk of stroke.
What is (are) High Blood Pressure and Kidney Disease ?,"The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short. Kidneys work at the microscopic level. The kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. The filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which sends needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removes wastes. The final product becomes urine."
