I am a 40 year old female and have have some mildly high blood pressure readings over the past couple years. I am not over weight and fairly physically active. My reading can vary quite a bit but my systolic is usually 120-135, my diastolic can be around 84 up to 95 at times. I read and have gotten some conflicting recommendations if I need BP meds, it seems that systolic is the number of more concern, is this correct or is that just for older adults? Since I am young I would rather not be on BP meds if I do not have to. Are any supplements recommended besides reducing salt, diet, exercise, all these things I have already done. Thank you for your answer!,hello, after going through your medical query i understand your concern and would like to tell you that definitely lifestyle modification like low dietary salt, moderate exercise can keep your blood pressure healthy. keep noticing your blood pressure, if after lifestyle modification your blood pressure is more than 140/90 then only you need medication otherwise continue with a healthy lifestyle. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.
What is the recommended treatment for patients with blood pressure that is significantly above the goal value?,Patients with BP > 20/10 mmHg above goal should use two antihypertensives.
